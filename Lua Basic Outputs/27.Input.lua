--[[As of now we stored values that we thought about in variables. Programs usually don't work this way. 
We receive values from an outer source, a user for example.

To get input from a user or the system we need to write:]]

var = io.read()
--This will store the input in the variable var.

--The input is always of type string. For example, if the input is 56 then var will hold the string "56".

--[[Write a program that get input from the user (their name), and then outputs Hello, followed by a space and the 
user's inputted name.

For example, if the user inputs Bob, the expected output is Hello, Bob.

You will need to:

Use io.read() to get input from the user.
Store the input in a variable.
Print Hello, and the stored variable in the end (add a space after the comma).]]

name = io.read()
print("Hello, " .. name)
